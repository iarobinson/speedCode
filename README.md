# Just an Idea

I would love to see a speed function typing game

Similar to old speed typing games.

# Levels

The levels would be writing simple functions really quickly

1. Write if statements
    * if girl return true else return false
    * if yes return true else return false
    * etc.
2. Write a for loop:
    * log all numbers between 5 and 10
    * log all numbers between 12 and 80
    * log all numbers between 1 and 10
    * etc.
3. Write a forEach function from a given object:
    * log all names
    * log all phone numbers
    * log all pets

This is the gist. The game should be able to generate a limitless number of random tests. This will gameify the process of learning syntax.


# Goal

People would get a simple WPM type score so they can compete with themselves on getting faster at writing functions.

Perhaps this would inspire people to get good at writing functions earlier on. It would take the consequences out of writing your first functions. When I was learning, I spent too much time finding new functions to write. It would have been great to have a random one generated and I try to beat my old time.

# To Do

- [ ] Write HTML for Testing
- [ ] CSS style for simplicity
- [ ] JavaScript for timing
- [ ] JavaScript for tracking errors
- [ ] JavaScript for feeding results
- [ ] Share buttons

## Further Down The Line

- [ ] Allow users to login and get badges based on speed on specific levels
- [ ] Create a leaderboard for top scorers
- [ ] Provide a tutorial process for people with 0 experience
